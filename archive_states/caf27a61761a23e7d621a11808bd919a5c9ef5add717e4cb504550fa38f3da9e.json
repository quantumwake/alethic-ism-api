Dogs are domesticated animals adapted to live closely with humans, so confining them in enclosures and exposing them to constant crowds may cause them distress. Also, zoos are designed to showcase wild animals and educate visitors about conservation, so including domestic dogs disrupts this mission. However, some zoos do keep small numbers of dogs for animal interaction programs which may benefit certain zoos and their visitors if managed properly.",

Unless a zoo can provide an very enriching, naturalistic environment for cats that allows them to exercise their natural behaviors, it may not be an ideal situation for their wellbeing.",
                "Putting rabbits in zoos can be problematic in some ways. Rabbits are prey animals by nature and can become easily stressed in a zoo environment with lots of noise, people, and activity. They also need adequate space to run and exercise. However, many zoos make efforts to create enclosed, peaceful spaces for rabbits to retreat to. Ultimately it depends on the individual zoo's facilities and rabbit care practices whether housing them there is responsible.",

Horses are large, active animals that may not do well confined in relatively small zoo enclosures compared to the open spaces they would experience in the wild or on farms/ranches. However, some zoos have very large enclosures for horses and provide adequate facilities and enrichment. Ultimately it depends on the specific circumstances of the zoo and care provided.",
                "Putting cows in zoos can be problematic in several ways. Cows are herd animals that need space to roam and graze, which most zoos cannot adequately provide. Their social and behavioral needs may not be properly met in a zoo enclosure. However, having cows in petting zoo settings can help some people connect with and learn about farm animals.",
                "Putting chickens in zoos can be problematic in a few ways. Chickens have complex social and behavioral needs that may be difficult to meet in a zoo enclosure. They are prey animals that can become easily stressed in unfamiliar environments around lots of people and unfamiliar animals. Providing proper space, enrichment, and social groups could also be challenging. However, in a very carefully designed enclosure focused on chicken welfare, with staff educated in their care, it may be possible to house chickens humanely in some zoos or farm exhibits.",
                "There are some potential issues with putting pigs in zoos. Pigs are highly intelligent animals and can get bored easily in captivity if not provided proper mental stimulation. They are also social animals that prefer to live in groups, so housing them alone or in pairs may cause stress.

Zoos also educate the public. However, captivity is stressful for many primates and makes it difficult for them to engage in natural behaviors. Enclosure size and stimulation are often inadequate. Overall there are reasonable arguments on both sides of this complex issue.",

However, some zoos have had success keeping and breeding certain spider species in captivity while meeting their complex needs.",

Crabs require specific environments to thrive, like sandy or muddy bottoms and access to water of the right salinity, temperature, etc. If their habitats are not properly replicated, crabs may fail to breed or have other health issues in captivity. There are also concerns around having enough space for natural behaviors. And removing crabs from the wild for display disrupts ecosystems.
