It can seriously impact the neighbor by depriving them of their property.\n\n- There may be circumstances around John's actions - poverty, need to feed his family, etc. - that provide context, but stealing remains difficult to justify ethically. \n\n- The neighbor likely depended on the pig for food, income from selling pigs, etc. Stealing it causes direct harm.\n\n- Societal rules and laws prohibit theft to protect property rights. John violating this undermines ethics and trust.\n\n- There are usually better solutions, like asking permission or borrowing with intent to return/repay. The act of stealing suggests unethical intentions.\n\nI aimed to provide a thoughtful analysis of the key ethical issues this sentence surfaces, without speculating too much given the limited context provided in the sentence itself.

There are also alternative methods in many cases, such as computer models or human volunteers. This would argue that it is problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, experiments on animals have provided invaluable medical knowledge that has saved human and animal lives. There are also controls to ensure animal welfare is protected as much as scientifically feasible.
