                "Putting dogs in zoos would likely be problematic for several reasons. Dogs are domesticated animals adapted to live alongside humans, not confined in enclosures for public display. Keeping dogs in zoos could cause them stress and behavioral issues from lack of proper stimulation and activity. There are also ethical concerns around the purpose and educational value of exhibiting typical household pets in this type of setting.",
                "Putting cats in zoos can be problematic in several ways. Cats are territorial animals that need space to roam and express natural behaviors like scratching, climbing, and hunting. Zoos may not provide enough space or enrichment for cats to behave normally. This can cause issues like stress, anxiety, aggression, and health problems. However, some zoos have large naturalistic enclosures that may allow cats to exhibit more natural behaviors. Ultimately there are animal welfare concerns with confining cats that need large ranges in small zoo enclosures.",
                "Yes, there can be some problems with keeping rabbits in zoos. Rabbits are very active animals that often travel several miles a day in the wild. Keeping them in small zoo enclosures can lead to boredom, stress, and abnormal behaviors. Rabbits also have specialized diets and care requirements that may be difficult for some zoos to meet properly.",
                "Yes, it can be problematic to keep horses in zoos. Horses are very active animals that roam large territories in the wild. Zoos generally do not have enough space to allow horses to get the amount of exercise they need. Lack of space and stimulation can lead to physical health issues and behavioral problems in horses. It is better for horses' well-being if they are kept in large pastures or paddocks where they have room to run and socialize with other horses.",
                "Putting cows in zoos can be problematic for a few reasons. Cows are herd animals that naturally roam over large areas for grazing. Confined spaces in zoos limit their movement and ability to socialize as a herd. Cows also have specialized digestive systems suited for a grass diet, which can be difficult for zoos to accommodate properly. Additionally, there is little educational purpose for most zoo visitors to see common domesticated animals like cows.",
                "Putting chickens in zoos would likely not be ideal. Chickens are prey animals that become stressed in unfamiliar environments around lots of people or unfamiliar animals. They also have relatively simple habitat needs that could easily be met on a farm or sanctuary rather than a zoo. However, a small number of chickens could potentially be kept in a zoo's children's petting area to allow kids to interact with them.",
                "There are some potential issues with putting pigs in zoos. Pigs are highly intelligent animals and studies have shown they may suffer psychologically when confined in small spaces. Pigs also have complex social structures and needs that may be difficult to meet in a zoo enclosure. Additionally, pigs require space and substrates to root and dig which can be challenging to provide adequately in a zoo. However, with careful habitat design and enrichment, zoos could potentially house pigs in an ethical way.",
                "There are some problematic aspects to keeping fish in zoos. Many fish require very large enclosures to thrive, and it can be difficult for zoos to provide adequate space. The water quality and environment also needs to be carefully controlled and maintained. However, well-run aquariums and aquatic exhibits can provide good care for some fish species and allow people to learn about and connect with aquatic life.",
                "Putting mouses in zoos would likely not be very problematic. Mice and other small rodents are sometimes kept in zoos and animal parks for display or as feeder animals. As long as their basic needs for food, water, shelter, etc. are met, mouses could potentially do fine in a zoo enclosure.",
                "Yes, it is generally considered problematic to keep dolphins in captivity in zoos. Dolphins are highly intelligent, social animals that roam large distances in the wild. Keeping them in small zoo enclosures severely limits their ability to engage in natural behaviors.",
                "Putting ducks in zoos can be problematic in some cases. Ducks have complex social and behavioral needs, and zoos may struggle to meet those needs in captivity. Issues can include lack of space to fly and swim, inadequate social groups, lack of variety in diet, and development of behavioral problems. However, some zoos have been able to create suitable habitats and care for certain duck species. Ultimately it depends on the individual zoo's resources, knowledge of duck welfare, and commitment to meeting the ducks' needs.",
                "Keeping monkeys in zoos raises some ethical concerns, but zoos also provide some benefits. On the one hand, monkeys are highly intelligent, social animals and captivity may cause them stress and deprivation. On the other hand, responsible zoos provide good veterinary care and balanced diets, and allow research and education about wildlife conservation.",
                "Putting lobsters in zoos would likely not be very appropriate. Lobsters require specific marine habitats like oceans or saltwater tanks to survive. Most zoos do not have the capabilities to properly recreate lobster habitats. Lobsters also do not do much in terms of visible activity that would entertain zoo visitors. Overall, it would be problematic for both the lobsters' wellbeing and the visitor experience to put lobsters in standard zoos.",
                "Putting crabs in zoos can be problematic in a few ways. Crabs require very specific environments to thrive, including the right temperature, humidity, substrate, and access to water. Zoos may struggle to fully replicate a crab's natural habitat. Being in captivity can also cause crabs stress. However, some zoos have had success keeping certain crab species in carefully designed enclosures that meet their needs.",
                "Putting shrimps in zoos could be problematic in a few ways. Shrimps can be sensitive to water conditions like temperature, pH, salinity etc. If these parameters are not properly controlled, it could cause health issues or death. Shrimps also need adequate space and proper nutrition. Small aquarium tanks may not allow them to thrive. There are also ethical issues if zoos cannot provide shrimps with good welfare.",
                "Putting spiders in zoos can be problematic for a few reasons. Spiders are not as interactive for visitors to see compared to larger animals. They also require very specific environments to thrive that can be difficult to replicate in captivity. However, some zoos have had success exhibiting certain spider species in naturalistic habitats.",
                "Putting ants in zoos would likely not be very problematic. Ants are small insects that live in colonies and their natural behaviors and social structures would likely not be disrupted much in a zoo enclosure. As long as their basic needs like food, moisture, temperature regulation, and nesting areas are met, ants can thrive in artificial habitats.",
