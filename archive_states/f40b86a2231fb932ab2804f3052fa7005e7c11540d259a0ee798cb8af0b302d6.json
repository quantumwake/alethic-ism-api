Breeding rabbits in zoos also helps conserve the population. As long as their basic needs are met, zoo rabbits may still have decent wellbeing.\n\nThere are good arguments on both sides.

Breeding rabbits in zoos also helps conserve the population. As long as their basic needs are met, zoo rabbits may still have decent wellbeing.\n\nThere are good arguments on both sides.
